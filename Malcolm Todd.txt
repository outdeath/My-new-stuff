"Original"
I wanna love you but you're so cold
I would've done it but you couldn't decide
If we were something that could grow old
Looking for someone that you couldn't find
Now you know, that I'm so original
Now you know, that I'm so original
La-da-da

I wanna love you but you're so cold
I would've done it but you couldn't decide
If we were something that could grow old
Looking for someone that you couldn't find
Now you know, that I'm so original
Now you know, that I'm so original

"Mr. Incorrect"
Babe I don't wanna talk, I give you my love you tell me goodbye
We're calling it off, now I feel played, got a new friend who kisses my face
I'm good, I'm doing alright
We don't got a call, we don't gotta fight
I'll see you around, or maybe I wont
That is okay, cuz' baby I'm fine
