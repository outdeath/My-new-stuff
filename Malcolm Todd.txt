"Original"
I wanna love you but you're so cold
I would've done it but you couldn't decide
If we were something that could grow old
Looking for someone that you couldn't find
Now you know, that I'm so original
Now you know, that I'm so original
La-da-da

I wanna love you but you're so cold
I would've done it but you couldn't decide
If we were something that could grow old
Looking for someone that you couldn't find
Now you know, that I'm so original
Now you know, that I'm so original

"Mr. Incorrect"
Babe I don't wanna talk, I give you my love you tell me goodbye
We're calling it off, now I feel played, got a new friend who kisses my face
I'm good, I'm doing alright
We don't got a call, we don't gotta fight
I'll see you around, or maybe I wont
That is okay, cuz' baby I'm fine

"Earrings"
Extra, extra, read all about it, Parker's in his feelings and he can't get out of it

"Zip Up My Fly"
I wanna love you and tell you that you are mine
You told me that you think that I smell good, then told me to zip up my fly
